- 👋 Hi, I’m @ExodusG0d
- 👀 I’m interested in **stocks, asset allocation and social media**, I want to be a active participant on the Internet and spread what I know. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Statistics in Fudan University. And it's not until last few weeks I've found myself fond of coding and designing. So I believe it's not too late to get started. Probably it's because I'm a little bit tired of "time-wasting class" in the Financial Management and social requirement and such silly things. I finally choose to be in my small world. 
- 📫 You can email me at brokyneverfallinluv@gmail.com. Yes, you are right. That's a silly address name.
