- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ExodusG0d
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in **stocks, asset allocation and social media**, I want to be a active participant on the Internet and spread what I know. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Statistics in Fudan University. And it's not until last few weeks I've found myself fond of coding and designing. So I believe it's not too late to get started.
- ğŸ“« You can email me at brokyneverfallinluv@gmail.com. Yes, you are right. That's a silly address name.
